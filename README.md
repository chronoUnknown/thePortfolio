# thePortfolio

Essentially, this will be my 'portfolio' of sorts. Really, more of a hiding place for all the projects I make.

## Current Files:
### Pranks:
#### * gFormBomb: 
  Floods a Google Form with fake responses. << Currently doesn't work, I'll get to that

### ML/DL Models:
#### * RNGLearner:
   Takes a sequence of numbers as input, gives a Random Number Generator and a seed that would output that very sequence. Currently a ConvNet with Dense layers as pooling. Will implement an LSTM *eventually*.
